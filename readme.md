## Status of this Repository on GitHub

We maintain this GitHub repo ahead of public releases.

Note we have moved the previous "master" branch to "old-master".

The current "master" branch (this branch) includes an import on the CVS history from SoureForge as well as a sync to the latest developement version located on our developement SVN repository.

We are planing to transition the SVN development branches to GitHub also but haven't decided on a branching model and workflow yet.
